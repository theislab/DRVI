  abstract = "Single-cell genomics allows for the unbiased exploration of
              cellular heterogeneity. Representation learning methods summarize
              high-dimensional single-cell data into a manageable latent space
              in a typically nonlinear fashion, allowing cross-sample
              integration or generative modeling. However, these methods often
              produce entangled representations, limiting interpretability and
              downstream analyses. Existing disentanglement methods instead
              either require supervised information or impose sparsity and
              linearity, which may not capture the complexity of biological
              data. We, therefore, introduce Disentangled Representation
              Variational Inference (DRVI), an unsupervised deep generative
              model that learns nonlinear, disentangled representations of
              single-cell omics. This is achieved by combining recently
              introduced additive decoders with nonlinear pooling, for which we
              theoretically prove disentanglement under reasonable assumptions.
              We validate DRVI's disentanglement capabilities across diverse
              relevant biological problems, from development to perturbational
              studies and cell atlases, decomposing, for example, the Human Lung
              Cell Atlas into meaningful, interpretable latent dimensions.
              Moreover, we demonstrate that if applied to batch integration,
              DRVI's integration quality does not suffer from the
              disentanglement constraints and instead is on par with entangled
              integration methods. With its disentangled latent space, DRVI is
              inherently interpretable and facilitates the identification of
              rare cell types, provides novel insights into cellular
              heterogeneity beyond traditional cell types, and highlights
              developmental stages.",
